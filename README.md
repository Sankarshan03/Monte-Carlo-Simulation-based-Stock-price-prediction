# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-based-Stock-price-prediction

This project aims to utilize Monte Carlo simulation for forecasting stock returns and predicting volatility. Monte Carlo methods involve running a large number of simulations to model the probability of various outcomes in financial markets. By simulating a stock's price over time, we can estimate future returns and the volatility associated with those returns. Additionally, we will implement an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to compare the returns on investments and volatility predictions obtained from the Monte Carlo Simulation. To validate the models and enhance prediction accuracy, we will conduct statistical inferences such as Pearson correlation coefficient, t-test, and p-value analysis. Furthermore, we will apply Portfolio Optimization Theory to identify the maximum return for a given level of risk. This comprehensive approach aims to provide robust and reliable predictions, leveraging both traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques to optimize investment strategies.
